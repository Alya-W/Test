On May 26th, the Google Data Cloud Summit kicks off, the first in a series of digital events dubbed the Google Cloud Summit series, taking place over the coming months. Google Data Cloud Summit is a half-day event focused on using Google Cloud technologies to advance data-driven transformation. If you have conflicts next Wednesday, don't worry because the content will be available for on-demand viewing immediately following the live broadcast of each event. I’ve been pre-briefed on the news which is under embargo but unfortunately can’t talk about it yet.
